# TouchDeck app link v1

The app link shares the debug console's USB-Serial/JTAG byte stream. Text commands
and their `@td` replies remain available between binary frames. The device uses
VID `303a` and PID `1001`. Opening the port does not reset it.

## Frame layout

A frame begins and ends with `0xC0`. An encoder writes both delimiters on every
frame, including when two frames are adjacent. Within the body, `0xC0` becomes
`0xDB 0xDC` and
`0xDB` becomes `0xDB 0xDD`. No other escape is valid. `0xC0` is not a valid UTF-8
byte, so the receiver recognizes frames without a text-mode command. A literal
`0xDB` outside a frame remains text.

The decoded body has these fields in order.

| Offset | Field | Encoding |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `ver` | u8, always 1 |
| 1 | `type` | u8, message 1, chunk 2, ack 3 |
| 2 | `seq` | u8, copied from the request into its response |
| 3 | `flags` | u8, request 0, response 1, event 2 |
| 4 | `len` | u16le, decoded payload length, 0 to 1024 |
| 6 | `payload` | Exactly `len` bytes |
| 6 + `len` | `crc` | u16le, CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE of bytes 0 through the payload |

CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE uses polynomial `0x1021`, initial value `0xFFFF`, no
reflection, and no final XOR. Its check value for ASCII `123456789` is `0x29B1`.

A maximum decoded body is 1032 bytes. A receiver unescapes incrementally into a
decoded buffer of at least 1032 bytes, and the deck's holds 1100. An encoder
reserves 2066 wire bytes, twice the maximum body plus both delimiters. The
largest frame a valid header produces is 2061 bytes, a 1024-byte payload whose
`seq`, payload, and CRC bytes all need escapes, because `ver`, `type`, `flags`,
and a `len` of 1024 never do.

## Receiving

The deck applies these rules to the bytes it reads. A host decoder applies them
too, plus the host rules below.

1. After a delimiter, the next byte decides. `0x01`, the only valid `ver`,
   starts a frame body. Another `0xC0` changes nothing, so a run of delimiters
   is harmless. Any other byte means no frame opened, and that byte goes to the
   text path.
2. A frame closes only when its body fully decodes. A delimiter ends the body in
   progress and hands it to the decoder. A body that fails to decode, whatever
   its length, increments `crc_errors` and gets no reply. So does a body with a
   bad escape or more than 1100 decoded bytes.
3. The delimiter that ends a body, decoded or not, also opens the next frame. A
   closed frame followed at once by `0x01` therefore opens the next frame, as if
   a delimiter came between, and a lost closing delimiter costs one frame at
   most. Text right after a closed frame, or after a body that failed to
   decode, reaches the console at once, because its first byte is not `0x01`.
4. The frame deadline runs from the opening delimiter. A frame still open
   500 ms after its opener goes back to text, however much text arrives
   meanwhile, and increments `crc_errors` if it held a byte. The deck's read
   timeout is the time left before that deadline. A host writes each frame
   without pausing.
5. The console refuses a text line that holds a control byte other than tab,
   CR, LF, backspace, or DEL. It answers `ok:false` with
   `error:"control character"` and runs nothing. The console's existing NUL
   mapping stays, so a NUL from the host becomes `?` before this check.

`crc_errors` counts every body these rules drop: a bad CRC, an invalid header,
a wrong length, a bad escape, an overflow, and a deadline. A body whose first
byte is not `0x01` is text and counts nothing.

A host decoder also returns to text as soon as 6 decoded bytes are in and the
header is invalid, meaning a `type` outside 1 to 3, `flags` outside 0 to 2, an
event with a nonzero `seq`, a `len` over 1024, a chunk under 3 bytes, or an ack
that is not 3 bytes. It does the same when the decoded size passes `len` plus 8,
and on a bad escape. It gives the raw bytes of every dropped body back to its
text stream, because nothing on the host runs them. An idle flush returns a held
frame's bytes to text 500 ms after its opener, so no console reply waits behind
a dead frame. Each counts one error, as rule 2 does on the deck.

A host that stalls past the deadline inside a frame loses that frame, and the
rest of its bytes reach the console as text. Rule 5 refuses a line that holds a
header or CRC byte below `0x20`. A chunk whose data holds a whole printable line
after the stall point, such as `\nreboot\n`, would still run that line.

Only flags 0, 1, and 2 are valid. An event has `seq` 0. Requests may use any u8
sequence, though clients normally cycle through 1 to 255. A client keeps a
sequence unique among outstanding requests and matches replies by sequence.

## Payloads

| Type | Payload |
|---|---|
| Message, 1 | One UTF-8 JSON object with a string `m` field |
| Chunk, 2 | `xfer` u8, `idx` u16le, then 0 to 1021 data bytes |
| Ack, 3 | `xfer` u8, then `next` u16le, exactly 3 bytes |

A maximum chunk has 1021 data bytes and a 1024-byte payload. The codec validates
chunk and ack lengths. Chunk transfers, acks, and events are described under
Transfers, settings, and events below.

Transfers use a window of four unacknowledged chunks. `idx` starts at zero, and
`next` acknowledges every index below it and names the next contiguous index
the receiver needs. An ack identifies the transfer by `xfer`. Its frame sequence
echoes the request that caused it. A sender retransmits unacknowledged chunks
after 200 ms, with at most five transmissions per chunk, including the first.
A receiver must accept a duplicate chunk without applying its data twice.

## Messages

A response is a type 1 frame with flags 1 and the request's sequence. It carries
the same `m`, a Boolean `ok`, and the fields below. All times are milliseconds
since boot. Counters reset at boot.

| Request | Successful response fields |
|---|---|
| `{"m":"hello"}` | `product:"touchdeck"`, `proto:1`, `elf_sha256`, `version`, `running`, `sinks:["log","link"]`, `recovery:false`, `layout:"builtin"` or `"storage"` |
| `{"m":"ping","n":N}` | `t`, and `n` echoed when it is a number, string, Boolean, or null |
| `{"m":"link.state"}` | `online`, `frames_rx`, `frames_tx`, `crc_errors`, `dropped`, `last_rx_ms` |

`elf_sha256` is the running app descriptor's 64-character lowercase hex hash.
`version` is its build version. `running` is the OTA partition label, normally
`ota_0` at this milestone. `ping` omits `n` when the request has none, or when
it is an array or an object.

A reply echoes at most the first 64 characters of `m`. An unknown `m` returns
`ok:false` and `error:"unknown message"`. A payload that cannot be parsed as one
object with a string `m` produces no response and increments `dropped`. JSON
nested deeper than 16 levels does not parse, so a frame of 1024 `[` bytes is
dropped this way. An unsupported incoming frame type or flags, a full frame
queue, or a response that does not fit one 1024-byte payload also increments
`dropped`. A `ping` whose string `n` nears 1000 bytes gets no reply for that
reason.

`frames_rx` counts valid frames before dispatch, including frames later dropped.
`frames_tx` counts complete response writes. A `link.state` reply therefore
includes its request in `frames_rx` and excludes itself from `frames_tx`.
`last_rx_ms` records the most recent valid frame's arrival time. `online` becomes
true on `hello` and expires after 5000 ms without a valid frame. After expiry,
another `hello` establishes the connection again.

The text command `link state` returns the same state fields in the console's
usual `{"cmd":"link","ok":true,...}` envelope.

## Transfers, settings, and events (M2-05)

Every message below follows the response rules above. A refusal is `ok:false` with an `error` string.

| Request | Successful response fields |
|---|---|
| `{"m":"layout.put","orientation":"landscape"\|"portrait","bytes":N,"crc32":C}` | `xfer`, the id of the transfer it opened. `bytes` is 1 to 32768. |
| `{"m":"layout.get","orientation":O}` | `xfer`, `bytes`, `crc32` of the stored file. `ok:false` with `no stored layout for <O>` when the slot is empty. The deck then sends the chunks. |
| `{"m":"icon.put","id":"<16 lowercase hex>","bytes":12300,"crc32":C}` | `xfer`. The file is a `TDI1` icon, and its header is checked at `xfer.end`. |
| `{"m":"icon.list","cursor":N}` | `ids`, at most 32 ids, and `next`, the cursor for the following page or `null` at the end. A missing `cursor` is 0. |
| `{"m":"icon.rm","id":"<16 hex>"}` | no extra fields. `no such icon` when absent. |
| `{"m":"settings.get"}` | `idle_timeout_s`, `orientation` |
| `{"m":"settings.put","idle_timeout_s":S,"orientation":O}` | the stored `idle_timeout_s` and `orientation`, and `reboot_required`, true when the orientation changed. A field left out keeps its stored value. The idle timeout applies at once. |
| `{"m":"store.stat"}` | `total_bytes`, `used_bytes`, `layouts` and `icons`, the file counts of `/storage/layouts` and `/storage/icons` |
| `{"m":"xfer.end","xfer":X}` | After a layout put: the `layout state` fields `source`, `name`, `orientation`, `pages`, `tiles`, `icons_loaded`, `icons_missing`, `bytes`, `load_ms`, `error`. After an icon put: `id`. After a get: nothing extra. |

One transfer is open at a time, and a new `put` or `get` replaces the open one. The deck holds a put in RAM
and writes it only at `xfer.end`, so a transfer that is cut leaves nothing in storage. A put that sees no chunk for 2
seconds is dropped. At `xfer.end` the deck checks the received size and CRC-32 (`received N of M bytes`, `crc32
mismatch`), then parses and validates the file as a layout or checks an icon header. Only then does it swap the file in
with `td_store_write_atomic`. A bad file never replaces a good one. A layout for the orientation the deck booted in is
then loaded and shown without a reboot. A layout for the other orientation is stored and changes nothing on screen.
`hello` now reports `sinks:["log","link"]` and the layout source in `layout`.

**Chunks.** A put is a run of chunk frames from the app. Each is a request, type 2 with flags 0 and a fresh `seq`. The
deck answers each with an ack, type 3 with flags 1 and the chunk's `seq`, naming the next index it wants. A duplicate, a
gap, and a chunk past the window of four all get the same answer, with no data applied. A get runs the other way: the
deck sends chunk requests with its own `seq`, and the app answers each with an ack that echoes it. The sender
retransmits a chunk after 200 ms, five transmissions in all, then aborts.

**Events.** An event is a message with flags 2 and `seq` 0. The deck sends events only while the link is online, and
throws them away otherwise.

| Event | Fields |
|---|---|
| `press` | `page`, `tile`, `kind` (`launch`, `open`, `command`, or `widget`), `seq`, `t`. `seq` counts presses since boot. |
| `key.report` | `seq`, `t`, `type`, and `mods` and `keys` for `kbd`, or `usage` for `con`. `seq` is the key sink's count since boot, equal to the console key log's, so the app drops a duplicate and sees a gap. |
| `key.resync` | `seq`, `t`, `mods`, `keys`, `usage`: the last state the sink saw. |

The link sink queues reports without blocking, 64 deep, and never loses a release. When the queue is full it throws the
queued reports away and sends one `key.resync` before anything newer. A consumer releases every key it holds on a `seq`
gap, then applies the next report, and sets its state exactly on a `key.resync`.

## Widgets and dashboards (M2-06)

| Request | Successful response fields |
|---|---|
| `{"m":"widget.set","tile":T,"value":V,"caption":C,"bar":B,"stale":S}` | `tile`, and the stored `value`, `caption`, `bar`, and `stale` |
| `{"m":"dashboard.set","page":P,"rows":[{"label":L,"value":V,"bar":B}]}` | `page`, `rows`, the number of rows stored |

`tile` names a `widget` tile of the layout on screen, and `page` a `dashboard` page. Any other id is refused with
`unknown tile` or `unknown page`. `value`, `caption`, `label`, and `bar` are optional. A missing string is empty, and
a missing or null `bar` is -1, meaning no bar. A `bar` is a fraction from 0 to 1. The deck stores a negative bar as -1
and a bar above 1 as 1. It keeps the first 24 bytes of `value`, 16 of `caption`, and 16 of each row's `label` and
`value`, cut on a UTF-8 boundary. `stale` is false when missing, and the deck draws a stale value at 60 percent
opacity. More than 8 rows are refused whole with `too many rows`. A field of the wrong type is refused. A set replaces
the whole state of its tile or page.

The link task writes a set into the deck's state table and marks the tile dirty. A 100 ms redraw timer draws each
dirty tile once, so a burst of sets costs one redraw. A set is stored whether or not the link is online. The state
table starts empty for every layout the deck loads.

While the link is offline, the deck draws every `launch`, `open`, `command`, and `widget` tile at 40 percent opacity.
A tap on a dimmed tile logs `ui: offline <tile>` and sends no `press` event. The deck checks the link on its redraw
timer, so tiles brighten within 100 ms of `hello` and dim within 100 ms of the 5000 ms expiry.

## Concurrency and discovery

The RX task splits text and frame bodies before text NUL mapping or overflow
handling. The console consumes text at priority 2. The `td_link` task consumes
the frame stream at priority 3 with a 6144-byte stack. Each channel preserves
its own input order. There is no cross-channel reply-order guarantee. For
example, a ping may answer before an earlier long console line is rejected.
Asynchronous console commands such as `perf fps` retain their existing delayed
reply behavior.

The console never waits for a link handler. The RX task hands each frame to the
link's 8192-byte stream buffer without blocking and counts a frame that does
not fit in `dropped`. The two tasks share only the stdout lock, and each holds
it for one complete write, so a slow link handler cannot stall a text command.

Frames, console replies, prompts, and echo use `td_console_write` or its line
variant under the stdout lock. ESP-IDF log formatting uses that same lock.
A complete frame cannot interleave with a text write or log line. A console
stream can contain frames between its writes, so clients demultiplex bytes
before splitting the text into lines.

Discovery probes every serial port with VID `303a` and PID `1001`. A candidate
is a deck only if it answers `hello` within 500 ms with product `touchdeck` and
protocol 1. The client opens without toggling DTR or RTS. Windows opens COM3
exclusively, so mixed traffic uses one port handle and one receive decoder.

GPIO19, GPIO20, the USB-Serial/JTAG controller, its clock, and its power remain
untouched. This milestone adds no light sleep, deep sleep, eFuse write, or
configuration that disables USB-Serial/JTAG. Unattended recovery through the
ROM's reset into download mode depends on those invariants.

## Golden frames

[golden-frames.json](golden-frames.json) supplies hex wire bytes and decoded
fields to the firmware tests, Python selftest, and the later Rust codec. A
fixture's `valid` field describes framing, not message dispatch. For example,
an empty message payload is a valid frame but not a dispatchable JSON object.

The fixtures include every escape, a maximum chunk with 1021 data bytes, a
maximum payload made entirely of `0xC0` and `0xDB`, a chunk with no data, and
invalid CRC, version, length, and escape cases. Tests compare exact bytes in
both codec directions and preserve frame state across fragmented reads.
