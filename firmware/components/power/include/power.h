/*
 * The idle gate between the touch stream and LVGL.
 *
 * The screen is lit or dark as the CH422G says: lit is the backlight bit of ch422g_output(). Nothing here keeps a
 * second copy, so the `backlight` console command and this gate cannot disagree about it.
 *
 * A contact is a run of samples with a finger down, real or injected, from its first sample to the first sample
 * without one. Its fate is fixed at its first sample. Lit, and the contact is passed to LVGL unchanged to its release.
 * Dark, and the contact is eaten: LVGL takes the sample it took last, released, for every sample of the contact and for
 * the release that ends it, and the backlight is lit again. LVGL therefore never sees a press appear, move, or lose its
 * release, and a touch that wakes the screen cannot click a tile. A contact whose first sample was lit keeps passing
 * even if the backlight goes dark under it, so a press that LVGL has seen always gets its release.
 *
 * The controller can drop a finger for a few reads mid-touch, which reads as a lift and then a new press. So a contact
 * that starts with a real finger down within 250 ms of the end of an eaten contact is eaten too, whatever the screen
 * shows. An injected contact has no real finger and is never held back by this.
 *
 * With no contact open and the screen lit, the screen goes dark once the idle clock has run for the timeout. Every
 * sample with a finger down restarts the clock, so the screen never goes dark under a finger. Going dark clears every
 * key modifier first (keys_clear_all), so nothing stays armed or locked on a dark screen, and then clears the backlight
 * bit.
 *
 * Failed writes. A failed dark write leaves the screen lit and is followed by one absolute lit write, because a
 * timed-out transfer may have landed. The next dark write waits 5 seconds. If that lit write fails too, the chip may be
 * dark while its cached byte says lit, so the next contact is eaten and rewrites the byte until a write is acknowledged.
 * A failed wake write still eats its contact. It is retried on a later sample of that contact after 250 ms, and on the
 * first sample of the next contact.
 *
 * Photo idle mode (link-v2.md "Photo frame, idle, and clock") replaces going dark. While it is on the gate never darkens
 * the screen: once the idle clock has run for the photo timeout on a lit screen with no contact open, it clears every
 * key modifier and raises the idle face, which the UI draws over the Page. The face counts as dark for the next contact,
 * which is eaten whole and takes the face down, so the touch that wakes the Device to its last Page clicks nothing. The
 * backlight is not written for it. Turning the mode off takes the face down and the v1 timeout applies again.
 */

/* Starts the gate with the idle clock at now_us and the default timeout. ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE when the CH422G has not
 * started (its output byte reads 0, which a started chip never does), and then power_filter passes every sample and
 * every other call here fails the same way. A chip that started dark is a valid start. Call it once, after
 * display_start() and before touch_start(). A second call resets the gate, which is for tests. */

 * inside a spinlock. now_us is esp_timer_get_time() in production.
