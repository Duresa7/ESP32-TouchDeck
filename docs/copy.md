# Copy guide

Every word in the Open TouchDeck UI follows this guide. It has the voice rules, the words to use, the key strings for the new screens, and a table that maps every string in today's app to its new form.

UI tickets copy strings from here. When a screen needs a string this guide doesn't have, write it by these rules and add it here in the same PR.

## Voice rules

1. Use plain verbs, sentence case and active voice. "Send to Device", not "Submit" or "Layout Upload".
2. A button says exactly what happens. The same action keeps the same name through a flow: "Update" leads to "Updating…" and then "Updated".
3. Errors say what happened and how to fix it. They don't apologize and they aren't vague. "Couldn't send to Desk. Check that it's plugged in, then retry." Never "Something went wrong" on its own.
4. Empty states invite an action. They say what to do next, not that nothing is there.
5. No all-caps labels. No ellipsis except on in-progress states ("Updating…"). Use the single character `…`, not three dots.
6. Use glossary terms only (`GLOSSARY.md`). The UI says Device, New board, Firmware, Companion, Layout, Page, Tile, Live tile, Preset tile, Asset and Integration, and never the words the glossary lists under "Avoid".
7. Glossary terms keep their capital letter anywhere in a sentence, as in the glossary, the spec and ADR 0004: "Add Tile", "Needs Firmware 1.4", "Install Firmware".
8. Prefer the Device's name to the word "Device". "Sent to Desk." In this guide `{device}` stands for the name. Say "the Device" only where no name exists yet.
9. Say "this PC", not "this computer". Say "Open TouchDeck", never "TouchDeck" alone. Wire names such as `touchdeck` and `.tdfw` appear only in Details (ADR 0003).
10. Shorten wherever the meaning survives. Cut "your" when the owner is obvious, cut filler such as "right on", "exactly as", "now", and drop hints that repeat their label.
11. Write lists without the serial comma ("CPU, RAM and disk"), as the spec does.
12. Use straight apostrophes in code and curly quotes “ ” around names the user typed, such as a Layout name.
13. Raw technical messages from the Companion or the Firmware never stand alone. Show a sentence from this guide and put the raw message under "Details".

## Words

| Say | Instead of | Where it applies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device, or the Device's name | deck, your deck, TouchDeck (the hardware), practice deck | Everywhere |
| New board | blank deck, recovery deck, port that isn't a TouchDeck | A connected board without Open TouchDeck Firmware |
| Firmware | deck software, software, the new software | The program on a Device |
| Layout | buttons, layout (lowercase), config, profile | All Pages of one Device |
| Page | page (lowercase), screen | One screen of Tiles |
| Tile | button, key, slot | One slot on a Page |
| Live tile | widget, AI usage button | A Tile fed by an Integration |
| Preset tile | widget | A ready-made Tile an Integration offers |
| Asset | picture, icon file, resource | An icon, image or animation stored on a Device |
| Icon | picture, symbol | The picture on a Tile, in the picker |
| Integration | source, AI usage, hub (as a page name) | A connection that supplies data or takes commands |
| CLIProxyAPI | AI usage | The Integration that reads AI usage limits |
| Usage page | AI usage page, dashboard | The CLIProxyAPI Page kind |
| Update | version updates, download update, install | App and Firmware updates |
| Companion | daemon, service, backend, host | The background program, named only in errors and the tray |
| this PC | this computer, your computer | The PC the Companion runs on |
| Tap | press, click (for the Device) | Touching a Tile on the Device. "Click" stays for the mouse in the app |
| Retry | try again (as a button) | Buttons. Sentences may still say "then retry" |
| Forget | clear, delete (for secrets and pairings) | Removing a stored key or a paired browser |
| Remove | delete | Removing a Tile, a Page or unused Assets |

## Patterns

**Action, progress, result.** Every action that takes time names one verb three ways.

| Button | In progress | Done | Failed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Update | Updating… {pct}% | Updated to {version} | Couldn't update. {fix} |
| Install Firmware | Installing Firmware… {pct}% | Firmware installed | Couldn't install Firmware. {fix} |
| Send to Device | Sending… | Sent to {device} | Couldn't send to {device}. {fix} |
| Load from {device} | Loading… | Loaded “{layout}” from {device} | Couldn't load from {device}. {fix} |
| Restart | Restarting… | (the Device's status returns to Connected) | Couldn't restart {device}. {fix} |
| Repair | Repairing… {pct}% | Repaired | Couldn't repair {device}. {fix} |
| Import | Importing… | Imported “{layout}” | “{file}” isn't a Layout file. Nothing changed. |
| Export | (none, it's instant) | Exported “{file}” | Couldn't export. {fix} |
| Check for updates | Checking… | Up to date, or the Update icon appears | Can't reach the update server. {fix} |
| Pair | Pairing… | Paired | That code didn't match. {fix} |
| Save | Saving… | Saved | Couldn't save. {fix} |

**Errors.** Start with "Couldn't {verb}" or with the fact ("{device} didn't answer."). Then give one fix as an instruction. Put the raw reason under "Details".

**Fixes for a Device.** Pick the first that applies.

1. "Check that it's plugged in, then retry."
2. "Unplug it and plug it back in."
3. "Repair it from Settings, Troubleshooting."

**Confirmations.** The title asks the question with the verb. The confirm button repeats the verb. The other button says "Cancel". Destructive confirms say what is lost.

**Numbers and units.** Write "{n} s", "{n} min", "{n} hr", "{n} KB", "{n} MB" and "{n}%". Use digits. Pluralize with the count ("1 Tile", "2 Tiles").

**Tooltips.** Name the control in two words or fewer, then a shortcut in parentheses if there is one: "Preview (P)". A tooltip never repeats a visible label.

### Messages from the Companion and Firmware that reach the UI

Today these Rust strings show in the UI, most under Details and some as the main text. The Companion API gives each error a code and a message (spec, "API contract"). The UI shows the "New" sentence for the code and puts the raw message under Details. Locations are relative to `app/`.

### Strings the check script flags that no one sees

The coverage script below matches any literal that reads like words. These are internal keys, so they need no copy.

| Location | Old | New | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/lib/editor/icons.ts:18` | TDI1 | Internal | Icon file magic |
| `src/lib/editor/layoutStore.ts:103` | no layout is open | Internal | Refusal key, shown as "That change breaks a Layout rule." |
| `src/lib/editor/layoutStore.ts:177` | no free cell on this page | Internal | Refusal key for "This Page is full." |
| `src/lib/editor/messages.ts:34` | no free cell on this page | Internal | Refusal key, row above has its sentence |
| `src/lib/editor/messages.ts:37` | a layout keeps at least 1 page | Internal | Refusal key, row above has its sentence |
| `src/lib/editor/validate.ts:437` | no page {page} | Internal | Refusal key |
| `src/lib/editor/validate.ts:438` | page {page} is a dashboard | Internal | Refusal key |
| `src/lib/editor/validate.ts:448` | outside the {rows}x{cols} grid | Internal | Refusal key for "That doesn't fit." |
| `src/lib/editor/validate.ts:492` | outside the {rows}x{cols} grid | Internal | Refusal key |

## Checking coverage

A script lists the string literals and text nodes in every non-test `.svelte` and `.ts` file under `app/src`, keeps the ones that read as words, and checks that each appears in a row above with its `file:line`. Single lowercase words, such as "seconds" or "never", don't pass its filter, so the rows marked "Added by hand" cover them. When a UI ticket changes a string, it updates the row here.

## Graph Tiles

The stream picker groups streams by Integration and names each by its Preset
tile. A stale graph keeps its last line at 60% opacity, as on the Device.
