# The Electron updater keeps the existing signing key

The Electron app keeps the existing updater key. There's no bridge release: v0.2.0 doesn't update itself to the Electron app, and its Layouts and settings don't carry over. The maintainer has the only v0.2.0 install and replaces it by hand (decided 2026-10-30).

The Electron updater checks that key's signature before installing. A stock electron-updater setup without a code-signing certificate checks only a checksum published next to the installer, so anyone who could change a GitHub release could ship an update. With the separate key, a hijacked release alone can't. Installers stay without an Authenticode signature until there's a certificate.

Never regenerate or replace the key. Every installed copy trusts it.
